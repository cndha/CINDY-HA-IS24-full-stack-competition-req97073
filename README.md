# Coding Challenge for IMB

This simple data rendering application is the first part of the coding challenge for my work application with IMB. The app allows users to view a data table of all the products by IMB, add new entries, and edit existing fields.

The application uses ExpressJS and ReactJS frameworks and local JSON file for data storage.


## Set Up

React front-end:
* Install dependencies in "client" folder with ***npm install***
* Run ***npm start*** to render on http://localhost:3001
* Components are tailored to a typical desktop screen size.

Express back-end:
* Install dependecies in "server" folder with ***npm install***
* Run ***npm start*** to render health status on http://localhost:3000 and JSON:API on http://localhost:3000/api
